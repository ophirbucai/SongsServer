    "longDescription": "Peter Rabbit, the mischievous and adventurous hero who has captivated generations of readers, now takes on the starring role of his own cute, contemporary comedy with attitude. In the film, Peter's feud with Mr. McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson) escalates to greater heights than ever before as they rival for the affections of the warm-hearted animal lover who lives next door (Rose Byrne). James Corden, with playful spirit and wild charm, voices the character of Peter, alongside Margot Robbie, Elizabeth Debicki and Daisy Ridley voicing the roles of the triplets, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-Tail.",

His very existence seems to be a sin, but he wages a quiet war to rid the world of evil. He’s brilliant, charismatic and charming – yet reveals little about himself, has no name, and is known only by the last two digits of a barcode tattooed on the back of his head.  His hallmarks are a lethal grace, unwavering precision, and resolute pride in his work. But even 47 couldn't anticipate a \"random equation\" in his life of exactitude: the unexpected stirrings of his conscience and the unfamiliar emotions aroused in him by a mysterious Russian woman."

This Agatha Christie whodunit boasts an incredible international cast as some of the most wonderfully eccentric characters ever created. Ingrid Bergman won an Oscar for her slightly dim-witted, Bible-quoting Swedish missionary. Albert Finney is the dapper detective Hercule Poirot, for whom murder-solving is a precise, intellectual exercise. Poirot agrees to interview all aboard the famous train's Calais coach, hoping to find the killer of an American millionaire before the local police arrive. Packed with sparkling dialogue and visually rich in texture, this incomparable thriller received six Academy Award nominations."

An unforgettable name for an unforgettable woman. She grew up surrounded by Hollywood glamor, but, as an orphan, never truly felt part of that world. In 1943, with WWII raging and men headed overseas to fight, she lands a publicity job to recruit women into the workforce. Her skills—persuasion, daring, quick-witted under pressure—catch the attention of the U.S. government and she finds herself with an even bigger assignment: sent to Switzerland as a spy. Soon Alix is on the precipice of something big, very big. But how far can she trust her German informant…?<br /> &#xa0;<br /> After an Allied victory that didn’t come nearly soon enough, Alix moves to Paris, ready to immerse herself in a new position as director of publicity for the yet-to-be-launched House of Dior. In the glamorous halls of the French fashion house, she can nearly forget everything she lost and the dangerous secret she carries. But when a figure from the war reappears and threatens to destroy her future, Alix realizes that only she can right the wrongs of the past …and finally find justice. <br /><br /> &#xa0;"

    "longDescription": "The movie's legacy soared even higher when director Richard Donner revisited this beloved adventure 22 years later and integrated eight minutes into the film. Enjoy more footage of the Krypton Council, a glimpse of stars of prior Superman incarnations, more of Jor-El underscoring his son's purpose on Earth andan extended sequence inside Lex Luthor's gauntlet of doom. Reeve, Marlon Brando (Jor-El), Gene Hackman (Luthor) and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) give indelible performances that fuel the film's aura of legend."

In this outing, which takes much more of a comic tone than its predecessors, Superman battles a supercomputer and the evil businessman exploiting it. As Clark Kent (Reeve) and Lana Lang (O'Toole) become reacquainted at their high school reunion, a megalomaniac tycoon hatches a plan to use the supercomputer to achieve world domination--and only Superman can stop it. At one point, the scientist's meddling with Kryptonite causes Superman to split into two people, one good and one evil!",

With his former business firmly under his oldest friend’s control, Charly has spent the past three years living a quiet, comfortable life, devoting himself to his wife and two young children. However, one winter morning he's left for dead in the underground parking garage of Marseille's Old Port with 22 bullets in his body. Against all odds, he will not die. After his miraculous recovery, he embarks on a hunt for vengeance that takes him back into the seedy criminal underworld he thought he’d left behind forever."

His very existence seems to be a sin, but he wages a quiet war to rid the world of evil. He’s brilliant, charismatic and charming – yet reveals little about himself, has no name, and is known only by the last two digits of a barcode tattooed on the back of his head. His hallmarks are a lethal grace, unwavering precision, and resolute pride in his work. But even 47 couldn't anticipate a \"random equation\" in his life of exactitude: the unexpected stirrings of his conscience and the unfamiliar emotions aroused in him by a mysterious Russian woman.",

When meat becomes so rare that it is used as currency, residents living above a delicatessen must depend on a menacingly strange butcher (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) for their supply. But when a new tenant (Dominique Pinon) arrives and takes a job as the building's handyman, he unknowingly steps into the butcher’s trap...to serve him as the next meal!"
